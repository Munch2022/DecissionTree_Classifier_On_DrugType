# DecissionTree_Classifier_On_DrugType
Repo consists a code that classifies the multiple drug classes
This is a dataset which contains the basic data of patients along with their BP readings and Cholesterol levels and as per which drugs are suggested 
Dataset holds mutiple types of drugs - DrugA, DrugB, DrugC, DrugX, DrugY 

# Description : 

•	We are taining the machine with a small dataset to make predictions on the drug type 

•	Implemented Decission Tree model to solve this multi classfication problem

•	We have handled all the categorical values using Label Encoding and converted them to numeric for the training purpose 

•	70% data is used for training and 30% on testing the model 

•	We have set up the Decission Tree model with criterion='entropy', max_depth=4

•	This model has acheived 98% accuracy
